# Regression Portfolio

* Welcome! This repository holds all of the different regression models I have learned in my various statistics classes
* All of the work is done in R, specifically RMarkdown and the work can be found on a Github Pages site that can be accessed [here](https://ryanmadlener.github.io/regression/).
